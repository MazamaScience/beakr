# beakr 0.4.4

Documentation tweaks for CRAN.

# beakr 0.4.3

* URL fix for CRAN submission.

# beakr 0.4.1

* Improved examples in function documentation.

# beakr 0.4.0 

* Added native CORS functionality.

# beakr 0.3.2

function to deal with error responses.

# beakr 0.3.1

* Removed `httpuv_~()` function wrappers in favor of importing the functions 
directly from **httpuv**.
* `serveStaticFiles()` now works.

# beakr 0.3.0

Lots of refactoring with an eye toward:

* Renamed `App` object back to `Beakr` for internal consistency.
* Renamed `beakr()` to `newBeakr()` to avoid confusion.
* Renamed `http_get()`, _et al_ to  to `httpGET()` _et al_.
* Renamed `kill()` to `startServer().
* Added `httpuv_kstopAllServers()`.
* Removed `.addListener()` and added functionality inside of `on()` function.
* Removed the following functions as superflous for an initial release:
`cors()`, `on()`, `include()`, `kill_all()`, `list_active()`, `logger()`, 
`use()`, `websocket()`
* Improved documentation and examples throughout.
